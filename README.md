# Deep Learning-Based Lorentzian Fitting of WASSR spectra in MRI
This project is the basis for the manuscript with the same name submitted to MRM. The code for defining the single Lorentzian Fitting Neural Network (sLoFNet) used to fit simulated as well as in vivo WASSR spectra from 3T brain scans is made available together with the code for hyperparameter optimization and an optimized script for generating the Lorentzian parameters for full brain volumes.
